## Testimonials

**FundApps**

“James joined me one year into the FundApps journey and immediately took over all things technology. Over the course of the next 7 years, James and I bootstrapped and built the company together. James is obviously a first class technical mind, but what I think makes him exceptional is that he combines this deep technological understanding with excellent commercial savvy. On the personal side his calm demeanor is legendary and he is just an all-round likeable guy.”
