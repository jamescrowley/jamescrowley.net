Well, I&#8217;m now off Uni for 3 months over the summer, which should mean I&#8217;ll finally get time to code my ASP.NET content management system for Developer Fusion&#8230;. write some articles in the process, plus squish a few bugs on the C#/VB.NET code converters!

  


Attended a great talk by Scott Guthrie a few weeks ago on ASP.NET 2.0 at the first&nbsp;Thames Valley User Group meeting &#8211; and bumped into him at the train station later on his way back to London.&nbsp;Very cool. At least, it was for me! ;,,) Now all I need to do is actually get a hold of the Whidbey beta&#8230;..
