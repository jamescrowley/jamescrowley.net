This isn&#8217;t a new programme, but it seems a lot of people have never heard of this, so here goes&#8230;.

If you are a \*UK\* organisation that sells Microsoft products, or provides solutions based on Microsoft products and technologies to third-party customers, then you can qualify to purchase the [Microsoft Action Pack](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/partner/sales_and_marketing/actionpack/) for £199. You just need to be a Registered Member of the [Microsoft Partner Programme](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/partner/partnering/mpp/default.aspx) to subscribe (this process is free).

Some of [the products included](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/partner/sales_and_marketing/actionpack/contents.aspx) are

  * Office Professional 2003 ( 10 licenses ) 
  * Windows XP Pro ( 10 licenses )
  * Info Path ( 10 licenses )
  * SQL Server 2000 ( 10 CAL licenses )
  * Exchange Server 2003 ( 10 CAL licenses )
  * Windows Server 2003 Standard Edition ( 10 CAL licenses ) 

Well worth a look! (Though note these are not-for-distribution versions) .
