As some of you will know, I&#8217;ve run the [developerFusion community](http://www.developerfusion.com/) for many years now, as a part-time hobby. Now, some big changes are afoot! 2 months ago I packed in my day job to focus on the site full-time, and have now made the first big step and re-launched the site.

You can check it out at <http://www.developerfusion.com/>.

This is just the first step along the road, but an exciting one (for me at least!). The new site is going to make it even easier for developers around the world to connect with each other, and discover what&#8217;s going on in their local area &#8211; be that events, user groups, blogs or just general discussion. We&#8217;ll also be bringing a wider range of technical articles and focused developer news.

If you have any feedback, feel free to get in touch &#8211; the site is here for you! If you twitter, stay tuned at <http://twitter.com/developerfusion> for more updates.
