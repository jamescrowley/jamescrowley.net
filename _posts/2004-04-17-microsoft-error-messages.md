Apologies to everyone in advance &#8211; this just made me laugh.

  


_There was once a young man who, in his youth, professed his desire to become a great writer._

  


_When asked to define &#8220;great&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want to write stuff that the whole world will read, stuff that people will react to on a truly emotional level, stuff that will make them scream, cry, howl in pain and anger!&#8221;_

  


_He now works for Microsoft, writing error messages._
