I&#8217;ve just put up the first&nbsp;(of many)&nbsp;planned utilities on Developer Fusion &#8211; a conversion tool for automatically translating C# code into its VB.NET equivalent.

Feel free to take a look, and let me know if you find any problems. The credit is 99.99% due to the guys behind [#develop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/). I&#8217;ve simply made this tiny bit of their great application available online, plus added the ability to convert &#8220;bits&#8221; of classes or methods rather than just whole ones.
