I had a thank you email from [Pete LePage](http://blogs.msdn.com/petel/) on the Web Development Tools team the other day &#8211; letting me know that I was one of the top ten valid bug finders (as in, bugs that were actually fixed) for the VS 2005 product cycle&#8230; It&#8217;s always nice to know that we can all make a difference to the finished product.

In other news&#8230;. those of you who know me will be aware that I&#8217;ve been building up to a long trip away for some time &#8211; who needs to get a full-time job when you can delay it by travelling? Well&#8230; I&#8217;m off travelling a week today &#8211; and won&#8217;t be back home until the end of August. I still can&#8217;t quite believe it! If you&#8217;re interested, [keep an eye on my joint travel blog](http://onourtravels.livejournal.com/) , which I&#8217;ll be trying to update, along with photos, as I move around. Stops on the way include Thailand, Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, Mexico, LA, Toronto and New York. I can&#8217;t wait&#8230;!!
