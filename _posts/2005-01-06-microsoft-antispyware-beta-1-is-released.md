It seems the first Microsoft AntiSpyware beta has been released &#8211; you can get it [here](http://download.microsoft.com/download/8/1/5/815d2d60-49b5-44dc-ae35-fca2f2c6f0cc/MicrosoftAntiSpywareInstall.exe). This is the first public preview since Microsoft aquired GIANT&#8217;s anti-spyware technology. It&#8217;s looking good!

You can read more about it on the [winsupersite](http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/ms_antispyware_preview.asp).
