Just downloaded the final release of [MSN 7](http://messenger.msn.com/) and was pleasantly surprised to discover that the &#8220;What I&#8217;m Listening to&#8221; feature even works with iTunes &#8211; cool! In addition there&#8217;s now an option to displays the contact&#8217;s images in the main list, so I&#8217;ve got another chance to spot the contact I&#8217;m looking for &#8211; the majority of which generally have meaningless sign in names!

**Update:** if you&#8217;re having trouble getting this working, check out <http://pluralsight.com/blogs/craig/archive/2005/04/27/7783.aspx> &#8211; you basically need to go to Tools / Options / General and check &#8220;Open Messenger main window when Messenger starts.&#8221;
