Well, the second DDD day has come and gone &#8211; and I think I can safely say from everyone I&#8217;ve talked to, it was a great success. My thanks go out to all of you for making it such a great event. If you were there, and haven&#8217;t yet given feedback on the event, do it now at <http://www.developerday.co.uk/ddd/feedback2.asp> to help us make the next one even better (and as a speaker, it would be really useful to get some idea as to what I really need to work on).

I was pretty nervous giving my AJAX in ASP.NET presentation (especially considering the room was packed out, with over 100 people there), but I think it went down well, despite a few technical difficulties with the first demo! Apologies to those of you who turned up in the afternoon only to find it had been moved into a morning slot &#8211; but I&#8217;ve now put my slides up; you can [grab them from here](http://jamescrowley.co.uk/presentations.aspx). Any problems, let me know.

Thanks also to [Sarah Blow](http://geekswithblogs.net/waterbaby/) for arranging an excellent dinner following the event &#8211; it was very much enjoyable!
