Microsoft has released the&nbsp;source code for the [Windows Installer XML (WiX) developer tool](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/) to SourceForge earlier today&nbsp;under the [IBM Common Public License](http://www-124.ibm.com/developerworks/oss/CPLv1.0.htm) as part of the Shared Source Initiative. This is the first SSI to go &#8220;public&#8221; on [Source Forge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wix/) rather than a Microsoft site, and the first to use an externally created &#8220;Open Source&#8221; license.

  


There&#8217;s a discussion on SlashDot (<http://slashdot.org/articles/04/04/05/135241.shtml>) as to whether &#8220;_this another ploy from Microsoft to not look like the bad guy, or do you think they are embracing on the Open Source movement&#8221;_
