Want to dynamically load your two-way data bound templates rather than having to specify them inline? Well, unfortunately there&#8217;s no LoadBindableTemplate method in ASP.NET 2.0, but I&#8217;ve described a possible workaround at <http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/show/4721/>. 

I also demonstrate how you can use this to load one portion of a two-way data bound template from one file (ie a common set of input fields), and then a second portion from elsewhere.

Comments welcome, as always.
