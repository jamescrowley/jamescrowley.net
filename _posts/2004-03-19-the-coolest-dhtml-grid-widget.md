Came across another great DHTML Widget on SourceForge today (thanks to my good friend [Thushan Fernando](http://www.wsoftware.biz/) for pointing it out to me!). It&#8217;s a cross-browser grid called ActiveUI, complete with client-side sorting, resizable columns and icons! Very cool. Take a look at <http://www.activeui.net/>.
