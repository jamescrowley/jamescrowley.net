<P mce_keep="true">We&#8217;ve just updated our free&nbsp;[C# to VB.NET](http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/Utilities/convertcsharptovb.aspx) and [VB.NET to C#](http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/Utilities/convertvbtocsharp.aspx) converters on Developer Fusion &#8211; they&#8217;re adapted from the neat little utilities within the&nbsp;free .NET IDE, <A class="" href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/" mce_href="http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/">#develop</A> . They now keep your comments in tact too. Great for when you&#8217;ve found those bits of sample code in the wrong language! If you haven&#8217;t come across them before, they&#8217;re well worth a look.

  
<P mce_keep="true">**[Update:** They support generics now too!**]**</P></p>
