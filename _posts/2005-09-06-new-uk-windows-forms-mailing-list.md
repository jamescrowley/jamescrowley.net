After some discussion over at the [MsWebDev](http://www.mswebdev.org.uk/) mailing list, I&#8217;ve now decided to launch an equivalent list for UK developers that want to discuss Windows Forms related and other .NET topics. 

For more information, go to <http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/mailinglists/winforms.aspx>. Eventually we hope to offer NNTP and searchable Forum access to this courtesy of Community Server too.

Please spread the word!
