<P mce_keep="true">I&#8217;ve been getting a \*lot\* of feedback recently over the changes we made to the C#/VB.NET <A class="" href="http://labs.developerfusion.co.uk/" mce_href="http://labs.developerfusion.co.uk/">code translation tools</A> to try and tidy them up &#8211; but unfortunately broke a somewhat crucial ability to copy the code out in IE6! I&#8217;m still not sure why IE6 is so unhappy with the CSS and is preventing any sensible selection in the output page&nbsp;(any suggestions welcomed). 

  
<P mce_keep="true">However, I&#8217;ve now implemented a &#8220;view plain source&#8221; and &#8220;copy to clipboard&#8221; option which should at least get around this for now!</P></p>
