I've now got some enhanced UK developer event listings up on Developer Fusion &#8211; check it out at [UK Developer Events](http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/events/Country/UK/). Suggestions for improvements are always welcome. Made a nice use of the Google Maps API to do this&#8230; (sorry Microsoft, but the MapPoint service is way out of my price league!). Next on the cards will be setting up an extended RSS format for events (_there doesn't seem to be one at the moment?_) so we can pull information directly from UK user groups such as VBUG. 

Watch this space!

If you run a user group or other developer (or IT-pro) related events in the UK, drop me a line and we'll get information about your upcoming events listed, along with a page for your organisation.
