I find it incredible just how many great developer blogs are around now. I can&#8217;t hope that this blog will be anywhere as interesting as the rest, but this one&#8217;s \*mine\* ;,,) 

So, welcome to my blog! I suppose a short introduction is in order&#8230;.

I&#8217;m currently in my 2nd year of a Computer Science degree. Although force-fed an awful lot of Java * in the course, I tend to eat and speak .NET whenever I get the chance! In my spare time, I run [Developer Fusion](http://www.developerfusion.com/) , which has a collection of .NET and VB articles written by a wide range of authors, and a few of my own. Microsoft have also been kind enough to let me review various products like VS.NET/Windows XP, plus invited me to the Office 2003 launch in London last year. Oh, and I&#8217;ve also been involved in writing [WebZinc .NET](http://www.webzinc.net/). 

And that&#8217;s about it for now&#8230;.. Hope you all stick around, and feel free to drop me a line.

\* Actually, I have to admit&#8230; Java isn&#8217;t \*that* bad ðŸ˜‰
