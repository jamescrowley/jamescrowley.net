<P mce_keep="true">This announcement is well overdue, but better late than never!

  
<P mce_keep="true">After much hard work by the DPE team at Microsoft in the UK &#8211; thanks in particular go out to Clare &#8211; we&#8217;ve&nbsp;now integrated the <A class="" href="http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/Events/RSS.aspx?CountryCode=UK" mce_href="http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/Events/RSS.aspx?CountryCode=UK">Developer Fusion events feed</A> with the Microsoft UK community pages. This means that anyone who <A class="" href="http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/Members/SubmitReadme.aspx?type=Event" mce_href="http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/Members/SubmitReadme.aspx?type=Event">submits a Microsoft technology-related&nbsp;event to Developer Fusion</A> will also automatically appear on the <A class="" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/aa497440.aspx" mce_href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-gb/aa497440.aspx">MSDN</A> and <A class="" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/bb291006.aspx" mce_href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-gb/bb291006.aspx">TechNet</A> community pages too &#8211; talk about some great free exposure!</P>  
<P mce_keep="true">Any events on Developer Fusion also get<A class="" href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/3377/" mce_href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/group/3377/"> automatically posted to Upcoming</A>.</P>  
<P mce_keep="true">I&#8217;m also working with the larger user groups in the UK to ensure we can automatically pull in their events through the same feed format. If anyone would like more info on this, just get in touch.</P></p>
