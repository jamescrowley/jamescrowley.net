Just came across a _very_ cool DHTML Calender control that &#8211; guess what &#8211; allows you to select dates/times and stick them in an input field!&nbsp;Obviously its client-side, so its nice and fast, customizable, released under LGPL, and&nbsp;best of all works in&nbsp;almost any&nbsp;browser (Internet Explorer, Opera, Mozilla, Safari &#8230;).
