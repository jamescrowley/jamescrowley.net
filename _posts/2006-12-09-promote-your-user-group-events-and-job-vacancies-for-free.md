Developer Fusion has gone global! I've expanded the listings on Developer Fusion to include information about user groups, events and job vacancies from all over the world, rather than just in the UK. When visiting, the site will automatically display content most relevant to you (from your country!), and I'm going to be working hard to increase our coverage of these.

If you're involved in a developer-related user group, have an event you'd like to promote, or have a vacancy to fill, wherever you are based in the world,&nbsp;get some free exposure and head over to our [resource submission page](http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/members/submit.aspx), and I'll get it approved for you!

If you have any feedback, feel free to drop me a line.
