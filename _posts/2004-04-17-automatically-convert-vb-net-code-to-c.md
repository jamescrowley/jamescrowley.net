I&#8217;ve just launched another utility on Developer Fusion &#8211; this time, a [converter from VB.NET to C#](http://www.developerfusion.com/utilities/convertvbtocsharp.aspx). This is the **only** VB.NET to C# converter that I&#8217;m aware of which is currently online.

  


The code is very much a work-in-progress. As with the [C# to VB.NET converter](http://weblogs.asp.net/james_crowley/archive/2004/04/14/113235.aspx), the code is based on the great work of the #develop team. I&#8217;m currently bug squishing (and these fixes will then be passed on to the #develop team too), so if you find any problems, please do let me know.
