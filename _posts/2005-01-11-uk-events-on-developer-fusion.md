I&#8217;ve \*finally\* gotten around to creating a UK events listing on Developer Fusion &#8211; you can check it out at <http://www.developerfusion.com/events/>. If you know of any other upcoming UK events, then let me know. I haven&#8217;t quite got the submission system up yet, but you can just drop me an email and I&#8217;ll add them.
