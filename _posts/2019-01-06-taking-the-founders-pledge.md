Despite the generous volunteering policy we established, at a personal level my charity amounted to a few small donations, a little micro-finance, and some [occasional volunteering](https://www.jamescrowley.net/2017/08/04/exploding-cows-in-minecraft/).

I countered this feeling of &#8216;I should do more&#8217; with a vague notion. That is, if against all the odds we successfully exited some day, I&#8217;d finally look into which charities really do have meaningful impact and donate a portion of the proceeds to them.

When my co-founder Andrew introduced me to [Founders Pledge](https://founderspledge.com/), the concept totally clicked for me. I could turn my vague plan into a legally binding personal commitment in a matter of minutes. Even better, when the time (hopefully!) comes to donate they&#8217;d help me figure out the most effective charities to support the causes I care about.

At the time of writing they&#8217;re now close to $1 billion dollars pledged to charity by founders at all stages of company growth. They are funded independently, so there&#8217;s no cost to pledgers or the charities. Their [evidence-based approach](https://founderspledge.com/research) to selecting charities appealed and opened my eyes to the world of [effective altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org), giving cause for reflection on the existing charities and [micro-financing](http://theconversation.com/does-microfinance-really-alleviate-poverty-the-34-billion-dollar-question-87475) I had been backing.

Perhaps it&#8217;s not the [british thing to shout about giving](https://founderspledge.com/news/confess-to-giving) but if you&#8217;re a founder with a similar itch, do go check them out.
