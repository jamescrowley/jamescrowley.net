So&#8230; I&#8217;ve been somewhat busy recently! My Computer Science finals start this Saturday&#8230; and then a week later, my degree will all be over &#8211; one way or another! It&#8217;s been a great three years, but I&#8217;m really looking forward to being able to start work in the &#8220;real&#8221; world. Watch out, here I come ;-,,)
