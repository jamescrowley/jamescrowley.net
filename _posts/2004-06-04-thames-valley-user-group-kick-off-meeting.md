  Just thought I&#8217;d pass on the word about the first Thames Valley User Group meeting. It&#8217;s being held on 21st June at Microsoft Campus, Thames Valley Park (UK!). Speakers include Scott Guthrie (don&#8217;t think we need any introduction there&#8230;), and Andy Payne (technical architect at HP UK).

  Membership and attendance are totally free. For the full agenda, check out <a href="http://www.thamesvalleyusergroup.net/agenda.aspx">http://www.thamesvalleyusergroup.net/agenda.aspx</a>. I hope I&#8217;ll get the chance to meet some of you there! :,,)
