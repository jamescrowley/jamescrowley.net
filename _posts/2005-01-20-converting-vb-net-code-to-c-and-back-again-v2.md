I&#8217;ve just updated the VB.NET -> C# and C# -> VB.NET code converter on Developer Fusion &#8211; a large number of bugs have now been squished! Check them out at [http://www.developerfusion.com/utilities/](http://www.developerfusion.com/utilities/default.aspx)

The utility uses the conversion code from the #develop IDE, and any bugs we come across I&#8217;ll be fixing and integrating into the #develop code too. Let me know what you think :,,)
