Continuing on&nbsp;my ASP.NET 2.0/Generics adventure&#8230;. there also seems to be no way to specify that a Page or UserControl inherits from a class with a type parameter using the Inherits attribute &#8211; and doing this in the code doesn&#8217;t work, as the partial class declarations end up specifying different base classes. 

Am I missing something elementary here?
