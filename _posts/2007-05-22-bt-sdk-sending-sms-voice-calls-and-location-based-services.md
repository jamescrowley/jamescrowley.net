Another interesting side-point from the discussion this morning &#8211; Joe Black, director of Emerging Business and Technology at BT pointed me in the direction of their new <A class="" href="http://sdk.bt.com/" mce_href="http://sdk.bt.com/">Web 21C SDK</A> &#8211; available in .NET, Java, PHP and Python. What this does is exposes a load of functionality allowing you to integrate with their systems &#8211; including sending SMS, voice messages, conference calls, and location-based services. The service will ultimately work by purchasing &#8220;credits&#8221; for use within the system &#8211; but you&#8217;re free to experiment within certain pre-set limits at no charge. 

  


There&#8217;s also an interview of <A class="" href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=291580" mce_href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=291580">two of the guys involved up on channel9</A>, and some <A class="" href="http://treeho.us/phoneymashups/" mce_href="http://treeho.us/phoneymashups/">demo &#8220;mashup&#8221;&nbsp;apps using the technology</A> &#8211; including one that will send you details of the nearest restaurants based on your location after&nbsp;you send an SMS. 

  


Good stuff, and well worth a look!
