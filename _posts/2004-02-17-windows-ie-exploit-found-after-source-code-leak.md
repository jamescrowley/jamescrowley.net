I must admit this happened much quicker than I thought it would :- see these articles on [the Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/35611.html) and [Security tracker](http://www.securitytracker.com/alerts/2004/Feb/1009067.html) &#8211; apparently an exploit for a buffer overrun problem in IE \*5\* has already been released &#8211; supposedly discovered by reading the leaked windows source code.

I&#8217;m curious as to whether this source code leak will be a &#8220;good thing&#8221; for windows in the long run, or will end up highlighting so many possible areas for exploits in Windows that MS gets an impossibly hard time&#8230;
