I&#8217;ve just posted my latest article on Developer Fusion &#8211; [Tree structures in ASP.NET and SQL Server](http://www.developerfusion.com/show/4633/), which takes a look at how you can store tree structures in SQL Server &#8211; and then doing something useful with them such as creating a web-directory like interface such as the one below.

I&#8217;d really appreciate any comments you might have &#8230;! :,,)

(Also &#8211; if you&#8217;ve got any articles you&#8217;d like to see on Developer Fusion, please do drop me a line)
