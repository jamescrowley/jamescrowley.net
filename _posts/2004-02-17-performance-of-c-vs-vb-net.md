Someone asked me a few days ago whether there were any major differences between C# and VB.NET performance, and my immediate reaction was &#8220;certainly not!&#8221;&#8230;. until I just came across this [article on builder.com](http://builder.com.com/5100-6373-1027686.html). In it, the author points out that for the number of program he tried, the C# version consistently generated fewer lines of IL code than its VB.NET partner.

Does anyone have any insight into this?
