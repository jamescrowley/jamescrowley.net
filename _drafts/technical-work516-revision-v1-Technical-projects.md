I&#8217;ve worked on all sorts of technical challenges and projects over the years &#8211; some my own, with others, and for others. Here&#8217;s a taster.

### The agency projects&#8230;

#### Street Car &#8211; Back-office integration & e-Commerce &#8211; 2007 <em style="font-size: 50%;">(@ ANORAK DIGITAL)</em>

Prior to raising investment from <span class="js-about-module-abstr">Smedvig Capita</span>l and later acquisition by Zipcar, worked with [Streetcar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetcar_(carsharing)) integrating with their internal systems to provide a refreshed booking experience for customers and tight Google Maps integration.

#### Big White Wall &#8211; AJAX infinite PANNING &#8211; 2007 <em style="font-size: 50%;">(@ Anorak Digital)</em>

Working with the founders from initial concept, launch and subsequent interations for their [digital community for mental health](http://www.bigwhitewall.com). As one of the core technical aspects to the platform, I devised an AJAX based infinitely pannable, and zoomable &#8216;wall&#8217; with &#8216;bricks&#8217; of user generated artwork loading on demand.

#### Anorak digital &#8211; Font embedding &#8211; 2006

In the days before browser support, given our designers love for custom fonts, I devised a system that when embedded on a site, would automatically replace headers using the desired custom fonts, generating and caching the required CSS and images.

#### Anorak digital &#8211; delivery Platform & SOA &#8211; 2006

I introduced highly available infrastructure at Rackspace to enable us to host worldwide campaigns for customers. CruiseControl and Web Deploy were used for continuous integration and automated deployments, practices that were rare in the digital agency space at the time. I architected and built out a set of core set of services for features repeatedly needed for customer campaigns &#8211; full text search with Lucene, competition mechanics, user registration, email delivery.

### The pre-graduation years&#8230;

#### London Pass &#8211; e-Commerce platform &#8211; 2002 <em style="font-size: 50%;">(@ mission communications)</em>

I built a new e-commerce platform for [LondonPass](http://www.londonpass.com) that at the time processed several £M a year in transactions, integrating with WorldPay and SecPay and resolving various security risks with their existing platform.

#### WebZinc &#8211; commercial code library &#8211; 2002

I created the C# version of [WebZinc](http://www.webzinc.com) for WhiteCliff, a commercial component that allows developers to extract content from web sites, parse content reliably and automate form filling tasks. A few nifty things here, including using InstallShield and MSI for installation, documentation packaging (remember CHM files?!), ilmerge-ing the dependencies to create a simpler package, supporting COM, and learning the challenges of supporting and versioning an API that other engineers depended on.

#### Developers Pad &#8211; code editor &#8211; 1999

One of my first significant personal projects, I created a free customizable development editor written in Visual Basic, which was reviewed in leading magazine, PC Plus. I was pushing the limits of what was possible with VB at the time &#8211; using extensive low-level Windows API calls to build UI features like syntax highlighting, dockable windows (there wasn&#8217;t a standard way of doing this back VB days&#8230;), and extending the standard &#8216;common dialog&#8217; windows.
