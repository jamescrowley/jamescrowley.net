It&#8217;s been an amazingly productive day! We&#8217;re now also aggregating RSS feeds from a whole host of UK developers &#8211; you can [view them here](http://www.developerfusion.com/blogs/) . The list was predominently stolen from Tim Sneath&#8217;s [list of .NET bloggers](http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/articles/64515.aspx) &#8211; but if I&#8217;ve missed anyone, please do drop me a line.

I&#8217;ll stop shamelessly promoting my site now &#8211; honest ;,,)
