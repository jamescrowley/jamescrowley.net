Automated coding tests &#8211; all the downsides.

We tried take home coding tests (trying to ask candidates to restrict their time and just note what they&#8217;d do if they ran over &#8211; we&#8217;d check commit logs &#8211; obviously not foolproof).

Coding o a remote call.

If you’re giving your existing team the trust and freedom to do their best, then I think this comes across when you’re trying to recruit new talent. Any good candidate is going to be evaluating us too.

&nbsp;

We’re always working on it, but trying to then ensure that the interview process is structured and repeatable, so we can fairly evaluate candidates without being robotic and unthinking, and candidates get an honest view of where we’re at as a team and company is important. On our side, trying to see candidates _in as close to a work environment as we can through an interview process – ie writing code, reviewing code, talking about code with a future colleague. Understanding your own implicit biases are worthwhile too._

_You can also get it wrong and make mistakes – plus you can’t keep everyone for ever, and if their own goals don’t fit, then it’s best to help them move on than._ 

&nbsp;

_Once you’ve done all of that, it’s back to finding the right balance of autonomy and direction to do good work and support them in their own professional growth._
