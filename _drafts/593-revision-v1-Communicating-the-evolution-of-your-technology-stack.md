Any organisation more than a few years old typically ends up with a pretty diverse set of technology in use, changing over many years.

When reflecting on how to communicate aspects of our technology strategy at FundApps &#8211; and specifically our technology we were using across the company. I broke this out into segments &#8211; Office IT, DevOps, Platform, and then some technology specific verticals (we were using .NET and Go, so we had independent segments for each).

ThoughtWorks [technology radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/) is pretty well known &#8211;Â each quarter they release a new radar that highlights the changes they think are currently interesting in software development, with rings reflecting the stage of adoption (adopt, trial, assess, hold).

I ended up with a Google document somewhat similar, although with a broader lifecycle mapped out:

  * Future &#8211; something we&#8217;ve heard about, and think might be relevant
  * Evaluate &#8211; actively evaluating a specific technology
  * Adopt &#8211; we are actively increasing usage or adopting this technology
  * Continue &#8211; continue to use this technology as you see fit
  * Hold &#8211; avoid increasing dependency on this technology. It might be deprecated or we are no longer sure it fits with our strategy
  * Remove &#8211; actively working to remove this technology from our stack
