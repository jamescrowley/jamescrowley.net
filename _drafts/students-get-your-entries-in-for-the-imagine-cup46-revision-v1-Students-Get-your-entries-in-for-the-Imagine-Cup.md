If you&#8217;re a student, and haven&#8217;t already checked out the [Imagine Cup](http://www.microsoft.com/uk/academia/imaginecup/), then its definitely worth a look &#8211; for one thing, you could win $25,000 in the top prize for the Software Design Challenge! Any student who registers before April 1st will get a FREE copy of Visual Studio .NET 2003 Academic Edition, plus free membership of [theSpoke Premium](http://www.thespoke.net/premium/). Plus, the first 10,000 students who submit an actual entry will also get a copy of Office 2003 Standard.
