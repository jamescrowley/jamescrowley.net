I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d find anyone hiring technical talent right now that would claim finding technical talent is easy &#8211; between rapidly growing salaries, a shortage of , and diversity challenges at every stage, it&#8217;s a fun challenge!

I’ve probably tried so many permutations, each with their own pros and cons – but out of the folks at FundApps we have someone originating from every possible source. If there’s a magic bullet that a CTO has found out there, they’re keeping it quiet from me!

&nbsp;

Here&#8217;s some of the things that have worked for me.

**Personal network**

This is probably where everyone naturally starts.

Best possible, if you can. But make sure you&#8217;re happy with the consequences that it could not be right or work out. Open and honest on both sides.

**Recrutment events &#8211; SMR etc**

  * Understand who the audience is at the event
  * Spend time talking to the right people. Don&#8217;t be afraid to cut short conversations when they&#8217;re not right.
  * Significant investment of time from staff
  * Be organised following up after the event &#8211; at the bigger ones, individuals will have lots of interest
  * GDPR

**Recruiters**

  * Not tried, but exclusivity for a fixed period &#8211; give them a chance to do their best
  * Give feedback  -the best recruiters will listen. if they don&#8217;t, move on.
  * Negotiate, but not too hard &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to bottom of the chain

**In house recruiters**

  * Often retainer and/or commission.
  * Sometimes on-site, sometimes off-site
  * Be clear with them and candidates what this persons role is
  * Think through impact if they don&#8217;t succeed
  * They are representing your company
  * What&#8217;s the candidate experience &#8211; both for direct hires and ones externally.

**Talent websites**

  * Be prepared to move fast (good thing)
  * Salaries probably inflated
  * SnapHR, Hired, workshape.io,

**Trawling the web**

  * LinkedIn &#8211; connections
  * Blogs, StackOverflow etc. XRay search.
  * Reach out messages &#8211; ideally from engineernig team directly
  * Thinking about which companies you rate and might approach people from. Strategic over the timing of how long they&#8217;ve been at a company.
  * GDPR

**Family**

Perhaps unique but Hired my brother! Similar to hiring personal network. Family is a funny dynamic &#8211; they can wind you up and you&#8217;ll respond in ways you never would with a fellow colleague.

**Adverts**

StackOverflow, Indeed etc. Like any, track spend & conversion.

Angel List. Escape the City. WorkInStartups. Honest.Work. workshape.io

**Talent conversion  
** 

Makers academy etc. Diversity. Think about how you train.

**Internal  
** 

folks like x.

**Internships**

sadg

**Universities**

We&#8217;ve built relationships.

**Own precense**

Blogging, videos etc. Part of showing what you&#8217;re about as a company.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Once you&#8217;ve found a potential candidate, there&#8217;s a whole load more to think about to ensure a great candidate experience and working out if you&#8217;re a good fit for each other &#8211; but that&#8217;s for another time.
