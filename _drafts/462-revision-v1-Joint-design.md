Maybe don&#8217;t bother given Iago&#8217;s post?

Used to do everything by consensus. works smaller &#8211; starts to fall down as you get bigger. can then easily slip into &#8216;dictatorship&#8217; instead.

involve everyone in design of solution. hear them. doesn&#8217;t mean democracy making the decision.

consult, ensure folks views are genuinely heard &#8211; then make a decision. doesn&#8217;t mean they get their way, or it is lowest common agreement

&nbsp;

State views and ask genuine questions  
• Share all relevant information  
• Use specific examples and agree on what important words mean  
• Explain reasoning and intent  
• Focus on interests, not positions  
• Test assumptions and inferences  
• Jointly design next steps  
• Discuss undiscussable issues
