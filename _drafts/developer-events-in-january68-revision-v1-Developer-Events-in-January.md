      VS 2005 &.NET Framework 2.0 launch is the major event of 2005. Every kind of application development has been enhanced with must-have features.

      This will be invaluable to SQL Server Developers who have found the interaction with SQL Server security frustrating & for SQL Server Database Administrators who have battled with Developers over imposing a security regime. Microsoft have worked hard to find a way for both sides to meet & agree on a security model that gives flexibility to the Developer and Security to the administrator.
