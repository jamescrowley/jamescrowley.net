If you&#8217;re involved in a User Group (in \*any\* country), I&#8217;d encourage you to submit information about your group to Developer Fusion at <http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/members/submit.aspx> &#8211; you will then be listed within our directory of resources; like these [.NET User groups](http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/dotnet/178/UserGroup/) that we&#8217;re already listing. I really want to try and give everyone as much publicity as possible!

You can even go one step further and submit information about your upcoming events too. Any problems, just give me a bell.

I&#8217;ll be adding improved filtering to help visitors find user groups and events near them very soon.
