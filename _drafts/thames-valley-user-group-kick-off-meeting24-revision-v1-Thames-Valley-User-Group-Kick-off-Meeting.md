  Just thought I&#8217;d pass on the word about the first Thames Valley User Group meeting. It&#8217;s being held on 21st June at Microsoft Campus, Thames Valley Park (UK!). Speakers include Scott Guthrie (don&#8217;t think we need any introduction there&#8230;), and Andy Payne (technical architect at HP UK).
