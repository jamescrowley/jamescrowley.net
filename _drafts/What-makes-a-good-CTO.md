&#8220;How do you know if someone would make a good CTO?&#8221;, I&nbsp;was asked the other day. Having hired a CTO to replace myself at FundApps last year.

\* Understand what the business needs as a whole. Sometimes that could be \* Be an advocate for the customer (both for product quality)  
* Recognising that often the best tech is tech you don&#8217;t build at all  
* Reflecting on your own skill gaps, and seek those skills in others &#8211; be comfortable hiring those with far more knowledge than yourself  
* Culture engineering  
* Strategic  
  
Things to watch out for  
* Embarking on a &#8216;big rewrite&#8217; where you&#8217;ll see no benefit to the business for X months/years.  
* Micro-managing the team(s)  
*  
  
* Ensure that we are continuous delivery of value to the business &#8211; gives the business more flexibility. 

Firstly, the role of CTO is incredibly broad.&nbsp;
