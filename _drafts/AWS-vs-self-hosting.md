Starting out

Every $$ can count, but time does too. Trade off. Digital ocean etc.

Scaling

At Rackspace (which we rated), but as our needs changed the lead times to adjust hardware significant. Used cloud but at the time you weren&#8217;t going to run databases on this.AWS, able to provision more storage and servers on demand.

Stable

Known workload? Less rapid change in much of the stack.
