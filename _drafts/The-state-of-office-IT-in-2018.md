**Device management**

Jamf.Â Intune, Auto Pilot.  
VMWare alternative &#8211; but didn&#8217;t work for us.

**Endpoint protection**

Windows defender/monitoring. Others?

**Desk set up**

Laptops. Trying to get similar set up so can move around, work from home etc.

**Email, documents etc**

Google Apps plus Office.

**Meeting rooms**

Zoom, Google Hangouts, what speaker hardware.

**Access to other software.**

SSO &#8211; OneLogin, Okta etc. Wherever possible. Some irritating places like HubSpot that still don&#8217;t support it.

**Remote access**

Beyond corp. VPN?

**Local network**

Meraki etc. Don&#8217;t treat as any different from a coffee shop in terms of access to services. But still keep secure. WPA Enterprise still challenging without on-prem.

**Telephony**

Voipfone etc
