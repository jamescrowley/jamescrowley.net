Microsoft launched a revamped UK MSDN site yesterday, featuring a new&nbsp;&#8220;MSDN Connection&#8221; service. This basically allows you to customize the MSDN portal according to the technologies and programming languages&nbsp;you&#8217;re interested in. And even better&#8230;. you get an RSS feed too! ðŸ˜€

Definitely worth signing up if you&#8217;re a UK developer! Take a look here: <http://www.microsoft.com/uk/msdn/>&nbsp;
