Just thought I&#8217;d post to let people know &#8211; I&#8217;m about to start listing [UK Developer Jobs](http://www.developerfusion.com/jobs/) on [Developer Fusion](http://www.developerfusion.com/). If any of you have an open position that you need filled in the UK &#8211; and would like some free advertising, then please drop me a line, and we can get the job listed. Note that if you&#8217;re from a recruitment organisation, I might be a bit more restrictive as to what you can post &#8211; but we&#8217;ll see how it goes.

And as always &#8211; any comments/suggestions/ideas for the site are always more than welcome.
