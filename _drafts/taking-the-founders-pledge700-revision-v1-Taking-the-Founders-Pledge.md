In the midst of growing FundApps, I gave far less time to charity than I&#8217;d have liked. Despite the generous volunteering policy we established, at a personal level my charity amounted to a few regular donations to charities working on issues close to my heart, a [little micro-finance](http://theconversation.com/does-microfinance-really-alleviate-poverty-the-34-billion-dollar-question-87475), and some [occasional volunteering](https://www.jamescrowley.net/2017/08/04/exploding-cows-in-minecraft/).

I countered this feeling of &#8216;I should do more&#8217; with the vague notion that if against all the odds we successfully exited some day, that I&#8217;d properly research who I should donate money to and give a portion of the sale proceeds to charity.

When my co-founder Andrew introduced me to [Founders Pledge](https://founderspledge.com/), something clicked. I could turn my vague plan into a legally binding personal commitment, and given their knowledge of the charitable sector I knew their support would be invaluable to figure out where to donate when the time came.

Their focus on [evidence-based giving](https://founderspledge.com/research) gave me food for thought on the existing charities I support, and since leaving my full-time role at FundApps they&#8217;ve also been incredibly helpful connecting me with other organisations as I look for what my next step is.

Perhaps it&#8217;s not the [british thing to shout about giving](https://founderspledge.com/news/confess-to-giving) but you&#8217;re a founder with a similar inkling, do go check them out &#8211; you can make the commitment within minutes and get back to building your business!(https://founderspledge.com/news/confess-to-giving) but if you&#8217;re a founder with a similar itch, do go check them out.
