A couple of days ago I was invited to a meeting of UK &#8220;technical community leaders&#8221; at Microsoft&#8217;s UK headquarters in Reading (to take place in a couple of weeks). Obviously, I&#8217;m delighted to be considered a technical community leader&#8230;.!

Anyway &#8211; the main point of the meeting is to discuss &#8220;_**what Microsoft can do to help support you and your community**_&#8220;. So, if anyone has any suggestions/comments they&#8217;d like thrown around at the meeting, just let me know.
