I took part in an interesting debate today, organised by Microsoft, discussing the latest generation of new graduates, their role in the IT industry &#8211; and how they shape it, or are shaped by it. The discussion covered a broad range of issues, and definitely got those brain cells working! Some of the things raised were&#8230;.

  * <div>
      How our current education system stimulates (or fails to stimulate) innovation, and whether educational institutions &#8211; at all levels &#8211; could do more to support this.</li> 
      
      <li>
        <div>
          Establishing closer ties to business, at university level if not earlier &#8211; so students can engage with not only academics, but tap into the experience and knowledge of individuals with years of experience in the industry</li> 
          
          <li>
            <div>
              How can we address the huge gender gap in the IT industry &#8211; can leading women within the industry to try to break down some of those preconceptions by engaging with potential students at an early stage?</li> 
              
              <li>
                <div>
                  Moving towards a increasingly flexi-time, telecommuting business world &#8211; will businesses that fail to adapt to accomodate their employees needs struggle to hold on to staff? How will this affect working hours?</li> 
                  
                  <li>
                    <div>
                      Looking forward to the next 5-10 years and how technology might further change the way we work.</li> </ul> 
                      
                      <p>
                        All in all, a very good morning, with some very interesting folks!
                      </p>
