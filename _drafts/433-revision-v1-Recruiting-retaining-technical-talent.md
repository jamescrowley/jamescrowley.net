There are so many aspects to this!

&nbsp;

Finding the right people, at the right time is tough. I’ve probably tried almost every permutation – personal network, job ads, using an external recruiter, using an in-house recruiter, trawling the web and contacting folks directly, turning up at recruitment events, using a hiring platform, building our own online presence.

&nbsp;

They all have their pros and cons, but out of the talented folks at FundApps I think we have someone originating from every one of these. If there’s a magic bullet that a CTO has found out there, they’re keeping it quiet from me!

&nbsp;

If you’re giving your existing team the trust and freedom to do their best, then I think this comes across when you’re trying to recruit new talent. Any good candidate is going to be evaluating us too.

&nbsp;

We’re always working on it, but trying to then ensure that the interview process is structured and repeatable, so we can fairly evaluate candidates without being robotic and unthinking, and candidates get an honest view of where we’re at as a team and company is important. On our side, trying to see candidates _in as close to a work environment as we can through an interview process – ie writing code, reviewing code, talking about code with a future colleague. Understanding your own implicit biases are worthwhile too._

_ _

_You can also get it wrong and make mistakes – plus you can’t keep everyone for ever, and if their own goals don’t fit, then it’s best to help them move on than._ 

&nbsp;

_Once you’ve done all of that, it’s back to finding the right balance of autonomy and direction to do good work and support them in their own professional growth._
