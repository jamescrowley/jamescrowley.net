I'm back in the UK now, after a 6 month jaunt around the world ([photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/james_crowley/), for anyone who is interested!).&nbsp;

Now that I'm back, I'm going to start looking for someone to help me keep on top of the article and code submissions for [Developer Fusion](http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/), so that I can hopefully focus on getting some new community features up and running (and hopefully back to some more regular blogging too). If you know anyone who'd be interested in doing a few hours a week (paid!) editing these submissions, then please do get in touch.

Hopefully see some of you at the next UK MVP Open Day!
