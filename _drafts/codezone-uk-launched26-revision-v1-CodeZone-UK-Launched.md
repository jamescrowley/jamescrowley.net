For all you UK developers out there &#8211; [CodeZone UK](http://www.codezone.org.uk/) was officially launched during the TechEd Europe conference, after a lot of work on Microsoft&#8217;s part (with a little bit of help from community leaders to provide some initial content!)Â As of last Friday the site now indexes content from both [Developer Fusion](http://www.developerfusion.com/) and [DNJ online](http://dnjonline.com/), and hopefully many more as the site grows.

CodeZone UK was launched to bring together the individual developer community groups in the UK &#8211; from developer web sites to user groups &#8211; into a central repository. If all goes to plan, it will become a great resource of information of upcoming events across the UK, and new articles and other resources by UK authors.

If you run a User Group or website and are based in the UK, then please do [register on the site](http://www.codezone.org.uk/Registration.Codezone) and start submitting information! And if you&#8217;re a developer in the UK, then keep your eye out! The site has a few rough edges at the moment, but we&#8217;ll be working hard to make this a valuable resource for everyone in the UK.

If you&#8217;re elsewhere in Europe, and haven&#8217;t already found your country&#8217;s CodeZone site, then check out <http://www.codezone.info/> . You can subscribe to the free magazine too.
