I gave my first ever presentation yesterday at the [London .NET User Group](http://www.dnug.org.uk/) (held at Microsoft&#8217;s offices in London) on their &#8220;Open Mic&#8221; night yesterday.&nbsp;The talk was on &#8220;AJAX in ASP.NET&#8221; and I amazed myself and actually really enjoyed the experience! A number of people commented on my decision to write code as I talked in the demo (rather than pasting it and talking people through it), and by the sounds like this was a good option (provided you remember what you&#8217;re writing!) &#8211; but you&#8217;re obviously fairly limited on the amount of code you&#8217;re going to be getting through. On the other hand, if you can&#8217;t write it in the timescale of the presentation, then maybe the demo&#8217;s too complicated anyway!&nbsp;For anyone who&#8217;s interested, I&nbsp;put the slides and demos [online here](http://www.jamescrowley.co.uk/presentations.aspx).

Anyhow &#8211; my thanks go out to Ian Cooper for giving me the chance to take part &#8211; and everyone attending for being so supportive. I&#8217;d really urge anyone who&#8217;s got a topic that they&#8217;re interested in and knowledgeable in to think about giving speaking a go &#8211; if I can do it, anyone can! :-,,)

Next stop&#8230; the [DDD day](http://www.developerday.co.uk/) in October. Hopefully!
