There are so many aspects to this! Specifically focused on finding the talent in the first place.

**Recrutment events &#8211; SMR etc**

  * Understand who the audience is at the event
  * Spend time talking to the right people. Don&#8217;t be afraid to cut short conversations when they&#8217;re not right.
  * Significant investment of time from staff
  * Be organised following up after the event &#8211; at the bigger ones, individuals will have lots of interest
  * GDPR

**Personal network**

  * Best possible, if you can. But make sure you&#8217;re happy with the consequences that it could not be right or work out. Open and honest on both sides.

**Recruiters**

  * Not tried, but exclusivity for a fixed period &#8211; give them a chance to do their best
  * Give feedback  -the best recruiters will listen. if they don&#8217;t, move on.
  * Negotiate, but not too hard &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to bottom of the chain

**In house recruiters**

  * Often retainer and/or commission.
  * Sometimes on-site, sometimes off-site
  * Be clear with them and candidates what this persons role is
  * Think through impact if they don&#8217;t succeed
  * They are representing your company
  * What&#8217;s the candidate experience &#8211; both for direct hires and ones externally.

**Talent websites**

  * Be prepared to move fast (good thing)
  * Salaries probably inflated

**Trawling the web**

  * LinkedIn &#8211; connections
  * Blogs, StackOverflow etc. XRay search.
  * Reach out messages &#8211; ideally from engineernig team directly
  * Thinking about which companies you rate and might approach people from. Strategic over the timing of how long they&#8217;ve been at a company.
  * GDPR

**Family**

Perhaps unique but Hired my brother! Similar to hiring personal network. Family is a funny dynamic &#8211; they can wind you up and you&#8217;ll respond in ways you never would with a fellow colleague.

**Adverts**

StackOverflow, Indeed etc. Like any, track spend & conversion.

**Own precense**

Blogging, videos etc. Part of showing what you&#8217;re about as a company.

Finding the right people, at the right time is tough. I’ve probably tried almost every permutation – personal network, job ads, using an external recruiter, using an in-house recruiter, trawling the web and contacting folks directly, turning up at recruitment events, using a hiring platform, building our own online presence.

&nbsp;

They all have their pros and cons, but out of the talented folks at FundApps I think we have someone originating from every one of these. If there’s a magic bullet that a CTO has found out there, they’re keeping it quiet from me!

&nbsp;

If you’re giving your existing team the trust and freedom to do their best, then I think this comes across when you’re trying to recruit new talent. Any good candidate is going to be evaluating us too.

&nbsp;

We’re always working on it, but trying to then ensure that the interview process is structured and repeatable, so we can fairly evaluate candidates without being robotic and unthinking, and candidates get an honest view of where we’re at as a team and company is important. On our side, trying to see candidates _in as close to a work environment as we can through an interview process – ie writing code, reviewing code, talking about code with a future colleague. Understanding your own implicit biases are worthwhile too._

_ _

_You can also get it wrong and make mistakes – plus you can’t keep everyone for ever, and if their own goals don’t fit, then it’s best to help them move on than._ 

&nbsp;

_Once you’ve done all of that, it’s back to finding the right balance of autonomy and direction to do good work and support them in their own professional growth._
