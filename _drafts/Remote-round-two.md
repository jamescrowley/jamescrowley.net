Ideally &#8211; whole company remote. Then everyone is equally bought in. (many argue this). But reality is even for companies that are not native remote, it&#8217;s becoming a serious option. How then?

Have to have commitment from the team (if not the company) to support it. Investing in decent meeting room set ups. Company wide meetings where audio harder (catch box).

**Work from home occasionally**

Easy to just get head down, be available &#8211; catch up in person.

**Work from home bi-weekly (Jonny)**

&nbsp;

**Work from home on different time zone (Matt, Jon)**

Async more important. Slack not going to cut it. Some meetings you simply won&#8217;t be able to arrange with everyone. Be clear which meetings are needed. Visit every 6 months?

**Office in different time zone (NYC)**

Obvious, but ensurig their set up is right. They&#8217;re building it&#8217;s own culture. Still need visits to build relationships.
