I&#8217;ve worked on all sorts of projects over the years &#8211; some my own, with others, and for others. I thought I&#8217;d share a taster here.

### The early pre-graduation years&#8230;

#### London PAss &#8211; 2002

I built a new e-commerce platform for [LondonPass](http://www.londonpass.com) that at the time processed several £M a year in transactions,  integrating with WorldPay and SecPay and resolving various security risks with their existing platform.

#### WebZinc &#8211; 2002

I created the C# version of [WebZinc](http://www.webzinc.com) for WhiteCliff, a commercial component that allows developers to extract content from web sites and automate form filling tasks, featured in several leading .NET magazines. A few nifty things here, including ilmerge-ing the dependencies to create a simpler package, building out a documentation package, supporting COM, and supporting/versioning an API that other engineers depended on.

#### Developers Pad &#8211; 1999

One of my first significant personal projects, I created a free customizable development editor written in Visual Basic, which was reviewed in leading magazine, PC Plus. I was pushing the limits of what was possible with VB at the time &#8211; using extensive low-level Windows API calls to build UI features like syntax highlighting, dockable windows (there wasn&#8217;t a standard way of doing this back VB days&#8230;), and extending the standard &#8216;common dialog&#8217; windows.
