Forgive me for sounding my own trumpet, so to speak&#8230; but this is a significant milestone for me! [Developer Fusion](http://www.developerfusion.co.uk/) has reached over 500,000 unique users* in the last 30 days, which is great news, and the first time it&#8217;s broken this (albeit artificial) barrier. Next target: 750,000! Many thanks to everyone who helps out or participates in the community.&nbsp; I&#8217;m really hoping running the site can become a full-time thing now, which should loads more useful features for all our visitors.

In other news, after a few teething problems (ie, pulling my hair out for the last 48 hours), the forums are now using [Community Server](http://www.communityserver.org/) 2.0 RC1 &#8211; keep an eye out for the final release from the Telligent team on 20 Feb. Great stuff!
